# Preconditioning Techniques for Conjugate Gradient Method

**Summary:**
The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is a powerful iterative tool extensively used in various fields to solve large sets of mathematical problems efficiently. Preconditioning techniques serve as aides to enhance the CG method's performance by modifying the mathematical problems, making them easier to solve. This study explores and compares three preconditioning techniques - Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and incomplete LU/Cholesky - to identify the most effective approach. Through experimentation and analysis, Jacobi preconditioning emerges as the most beneficial, improving both speed and accuracy in problem-solving.

**Preconditioning Technique:**
Jacobi preconditioning focuses on simplifying the problem by isolating diagonal elements, whereas Gauss-Seidel extends this approach to include neighboring elements. Incomplete LU/Cholesky takes a more advanced approach by approximating the solution without requiring complete problem details. Each technique offers unique advantages, depending on the complexity and structure of the problem.
